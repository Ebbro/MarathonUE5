# MarathonUE5
This is a personal project to test myself to recreate the original [Marathon](https://alephone.lhowon.org/) game (1994, Bungie) and the trilogy as a whole in Unreal Engine 5.3+ (might update it if needed)

## What's the scope of the project
My goal is to recreate the first Marathon as similar as possible while learning to use Unreal Engine. 
The ideal scenario would be to create 2 Version of the game, one which is as close as possible to the original and one with some changes more in line with the standars of today.
In the classic version i would like to recreate every aspect from the movement, physics, sounds, enemy behaviour, weapons, levels but still do everything in 3D removing the billboarding of the original that in my view was more of a limitation than a choice. I might try billboarding but i don't thinkit's the way to go.
In the remade version I might try and experiment with some different movemente and physics combination, probably adding the infamous jump button. I would remake the enemy behaviour based on the type of enemy, in the original the had some different behaviours but they all tried to get in your face. 

I will try to create a level editor for both version giving me the possibility of quickly edit and test levels

### Setting expectations
I know i cannot recreate the full game so i'll go on recreating aspects one by one. My strong suite is game logic and design. I am very new to modeling and art in generl but i can try my hand with those. On the other hand i have no experience at all in Music and Sounds.
Hardest part might be recreating everything in 3D, i have little to no experience in that but i'll try.

### Want to give a hand?
I would love some collaboration, contact me:
- Discord: ebbro
- [Telegram](https://t.me/Ebbro_Edo)
Even giving me advices or tutorials would be great.
If you want to give some assets those must be yours or you must have an explicit permission to use those.

### Info
This project was started on 18/02/2024 and it is worked on my free time so don't expect much of it

### Licenses
I have no idea, just doing it for fun. If i have to put something just tell me because i don't really know.

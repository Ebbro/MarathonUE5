# MarathonUE5
This is a personal project to test myself to recreate the original [Marathon](https://alephone.lhowon.org/) game (1994, Bungie) in Unreal Engine 5.3.2 (might update it if needed)

### Want to give a hand?
Although i would really appreciate help i am gonna try to do everything by myself. If you think you have something that might help contact me, i will be pleased to have a converation about it :) .

### Setting expectations
I know i cannot recreate the full game so i'll go on recreating aspects one by one. My strong suite is game logic and Marathon doesn't have complex game logic so that should be easy.
Hardest part might be recreating everything in 3D, i have little to no experience in that but i'll try.
